# CI2024_lab1
First lab for the Computational Intelligence course.
I compared 4 different algorithms (Random Mutation Hill Climbing, Random Mutation Hill Climbing with multiple mutations, Simulated Annealing and a Greedy Algorithm) for instance 2 (see the instances below). 

The Greedy Algorithm performed better than the other 3, so I chosed it and used it for all the instances. In this table you can see my results:

| Instance | UNIVERSE_SIZE | NUM_SETS | DENSITY | Cost           |
|----------|---------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1        | 100           | 10       | 0.2     | 260.945719     |
| 2        | 1,000         | 100      | 0.2     | 5556.818961    |
| 3        | 10,000        | 1,000    | 0.2     | 97715.854504   |
| 4        | 100,000       | 10,000   | 0.1     | 1527629.114776 |
| 5        | 100,000       | 1,000    | 0.2     | 1772263.773202 |
| 6        | 100,000       | 10,000   | 0.3     | 1760130.929966 |
